# This is EventOcto...
EventOcto is block-based coding IDE that generates JavaScript for things you need for coding a website... This is also used for creating Scratch extensions and more! There are stuff that are like this, including [TurboBuilder](turbobuilder-steel.vercel.app) and others which are unknown... More will be stated in the wiki, but are you ready for a long description?
This will be our trip to coding with blocky JS!

# Blocks
Blocks are puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in EventOcto. The blocks connect to each other vertically like a jigsaw puzzle, where each block type (hat, stack, reporter, boolean, or cap) has its own shape and its own slot shape for it to be inserted into. Series of connected blocks are called scripts. That is what blocks are!

# Categories
Block categories are the way blocks are sorted in EventOcto's block palette. Blocks are categorized based on their functionality, and blocks within the same category share the same color. The separation of color among categories allows better distinction of the parts of a project and increases the ease of access. That is what categories are!
